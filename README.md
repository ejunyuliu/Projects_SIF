**./oblique_conhere/PSF_oblique.py**: 

a general program to generate interference pattern of a single 
nano-particle under different depth, oblique and azimuth angle. 
And the inner function 'iPSF_misalignment' (line 21-39)
matches the equations of RO-iSCAT model.


**./defocused_snr/snr_CAF.py**:

script to calculate the snr of several rois choosen from CAF cells and 
background for Fig 3. And the SNR method is referred by the equation
in the plot Fig 3c.


**./defocused_shifting/misalign_fit_expt_shifting.py**:

script to combine and visualize the experimental and simulated 
lateral shifting related to defocused depth, as shown in Fig 2c.


**./defocused_shifting/misalign_save_RO_patterns.py**:

script to simulate interference pattern of single nano particle
under conditions of 1) 22 deg oblique, 2) 10um or 10nm defocusing, 3)
0 or 120 deg azimuth. As shown in Fig 2b.


**./PSF_comparison/generate_PSF_real.py**:
codes to generate widefield, confocal, RO. 
To simplify, all of these PSFs are generated by Gaussian kernel 
corresponding to given FWHM. In other word, we set the widefield PSF as
(fwhm_lateral, fwhm_axial), while the confocal one as 
(fwhm_lateral, fwhm_axial * sqrt(2)) according to empirical formula.
And the RO one is a integral result of azimuthal shifting based on widefield PSF.
